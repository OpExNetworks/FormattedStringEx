# FormattedStringEx

Swift 4 Xcode 9.n Format strings using Mutable Attributed String (NSMutableAttributedString).
Support formats for that string for use in labels, buttons, and other controls that support attributed string types.

## Introduction:
This is a simple example of how to creatively format strings used in various controls to make a multi line label for that control.  Unfortuantely, Swift does not give easy ways to format text in these controls so you have to create your string then work through the string and then manhandle the the attributes where you want them to occur in the string.  This example shows you how to create a title and subtitle for a label.  You can extrapolate from there and expand the capabilty to add more attributes or make further formating changes in your text.
