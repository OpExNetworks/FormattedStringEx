# FormattedStringEx

Swift 4 Xcode 9.n Format strings using Mutable Attributed String (NSMutableAttributedString).
Format that string for use in labels, buttons, and other controls that support attributed string types.

## Introduction:
This is a simple example of how to creatively format strings to make a multi line label for that control.  Unfortuantely, Swift does not give easy ways to format text in these controls so you have to create your string and then manhandle the the attributes to insert the formatting.  You can extrapolate from this simple example and expand the capabilty to add more attributes further formating changes.
